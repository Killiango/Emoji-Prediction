# Emoji Prediction

This project started as course work for the class 'Cognitive Science 2' at the University of Copenhagen (KU). 
Our final goal is to develop a multi-modal classifier that accurately predicts emojis given tweets. 

So far we achieved a solid 48% classification accuracy using a simple Word n-gram text based approach and a Multi-Layer-Perceptron.
In the future we will want to experiment using Dense Word embeddings and convolutional neural networks. Furthermore we aim to include a pipeline that analyses images.
