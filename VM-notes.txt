need to install Keras
need to get NLTK stopwords (import, then download)

make sure the 3 processed tweet datasets are on the VM
make sure to have the text-cleaning.py, classification.py and gridsearch.py


hyperparamters:

cleaner:

    min_df = [2,3,4]
    n_gram = [(1,1), (1,2), (2,2)]

    lower = [True, False]
    stemmer
    stopwords

   

classification:

    Naive Bayes:
        fit prior (boolean)

    Log Reg:
        
        max_iter 
        solver  = sag or lbfgs

    n_units = 50 ?? 
    n_epochs = [5,10,15]
    
      # experiment with multiple layer / or other classifiers
